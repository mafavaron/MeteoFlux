# MeteoFlux

## What is MeteoFlux, and what you may find here

MeteoFlux is a line of eddy-covariance systems designed, produced and sold by Servizi Territorio srl. If you need additional information, including contact data, you may find them all at URL

  http://www.serviziterritorio.it
  
As any eddy-covariance system, MeteoFlux provides lots of interesting but unfamiliar data like "stability parameter" or "turbulent sensible heat flux", and the question arises on which ones to use, how to deal with them (including validation), and how to transform to, say, dispersion model input.

Here come this repository: here you will find useful documentation, code, and related complementary stuff.

What you will of course _not_ find is a full implementation of MeteoFlux: for that you will have to contact its manufacturer, Servizi Territorio srl.
